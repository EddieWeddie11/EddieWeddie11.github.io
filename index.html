      Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
      you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
      made, and how you reflect on the decision now. Making coffee. During rush
      hour in hospitality at times you’re on autopilot dishing out coffee as the
      customers come flooding in, and at times the quality of each product can
      vary drastically.

      Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
      values and identity. Parents running away from their home country during
      the civil war seeking asylum in a foreign country has solidified my values
      in family, time and money. Family, you will never share the last slice of
      pizza with your siblings and for some weird reason you’d take a bullet for
      them Time, time is scarce and it is the most valuable intangible resource.
      You can never get time back so it’s important to utilise it, but utilise
      and “making the most of the time we have” is all subjective. If used right
      and with enough money, in my opinion you can buy time. Money, not in the
      materialistic way, but in a way that with enough money you’re able to buy
      time back into your day. Waking up and choosing how to live your day to
      the pinnacle of success to me. All these values came from migrant parents
      and the family business.

      Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning
      journey. Received a test score of 35% Owl and Eagle which was interesting
      considering the descriptions were polar opposite. I have come to realise
      that I am a very logical, methodically thinker who is fueled by common
      sense. I typically run scenarios and simulations in my head, assessing all
      the options and their risk percentages, and once I have decided my Eagle
      personality comes in and I become assertive and goal oriented - set in
      stone of my vision.

      Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
      development. How might these affect your learning journey? I don’t speak
      out for help as I want to try and figure it out on my own as much as I
      can, however in a team setting this can really hinder the team’s progress
      especially if the team is waiting for me to complete my task in
      conjunction with the team. At times I can come off insensitive or jaded,
      which can be a good and bad thing but in settings such as evaluation or
      giving feedback it can definitely come off as harsh at times.

      Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others,
      but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the
      time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other
      strategies you would try now and why. Had a colleague in recruitment where
      she was great at her job but she expected everyone to be at her level
      which was completely unrealistic. She lacked clear communication My
      strategy with her was to ask what she needed help with or what her
      priorities are for the day, and I would help with them asap but if she
      didn’t need my help i would let her be. This was effective because it
      meant we weren’t clashing
