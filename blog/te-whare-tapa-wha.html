    <h2>Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing)</h2>
    <li>
      Going gym 5 days a week, and going for shorts walk every 30-40 method to
      switch off (Pomodoro Method)
    </li>
    <li>Still playing sports like I normally would</li>
    <h2>Taha Whānau (Family Wellbeing)</h2>
    <li>
      Not talking too much about the course whenever I am around my friends and
      family, of course the occasional update on how the course is going is
      normal but not have it be the topic of the night or occasion.
    </li>
    <h2>Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing)</h2>
    <li>
      Really switching off and not thinking or touching anything to do with the
      course once I go home or past a certain time, that way I do not dwell on
      the problems I am having with the course
    </li>
    <h2>Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing)</h2>
    <li>
      Really wrapping my head around that this course is not the be all end all
      of my career. At times it will definitely be challenging but persevering
      through it will help me decide whether this career path is for me, and if
      it isn’t then I still would have learned a valuable skill regardless.
    </li>
    <h2>Whenua (Interconnections to the land and environment)</h2>
    <li>
      Walk to and from the course and taking any scenic route to really stop and
      smell the roses
    </li>
