      <h3>
        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now.

        Making coffee. During rush hour in hospitality at times you’re on
        autopilot dishing out coffee as the customers come flooding in, and at
        times the quality of each product can vary drastically.

      <h3>
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
        values and identity.

        Parents running away from their home country during the civil war
        seeking asylum in a foreign country has solidified my values in family,
        time and money. Family, you will never share the last slice of pizza
        with your siblings and for some weird reason you’d take a bullet for
        them Time, time is scarce and it is the most valuable intangible
        resource. You can never get time back so it’s important to utilise it,
        but utilise and “making the most of the time we have” is all subjective.
        If used right and with enough money, in my opinion you can buy time.
        Money, not in the materialistic way, but in a way that with enough money
        you’re able to buy time back into your day. Waking up and choosing how
        to live your day to the pinnacle of success to me. All these values came
        from migrant parents and the family business.

      <h3>
        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey.

        Received a test score of 35% Owl and Eagle which was interesting
        considering the descriptions were polar opposite. I have come to realise
        that I am a very logical, methodically thinker who is fueled by common
        sense. I typically run scenarios and simulations in my head, assessing
        all the options and their risk percentages, and once I have decided my
        Eagle personality comes in and I become assertive and goal oriented -
        set in stone of my vision.

      <h3>
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </h3>
      <li>
        I don’t speak out for help as I want to try and figure it out on my own
        as much as I can, however in a team setting this can really hinder the
        team’s progress especially if the team is waiting for me to complete my
        task in conjunction with the team. At times I can come off insensitive
        or jaded, which can be a good and bad thing but in settings such as
        evaluation or giving feedback it can definitely come off as harsh at
        times
      </li>

      <h3>
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why.
      </h3>

        Had a colleague in recruitment where she was great at her job but she
        expected everyone to be at her level which was completely unrealistic.
        She lacked clear communication My strategy with her was to ask what she
        needed help with or what her priorities are for the day, and I would
        help with them asap but if she didn’t need my help i would let her be.
        This was effective because it meant we weren’t clashing
