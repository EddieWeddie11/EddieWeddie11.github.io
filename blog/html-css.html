    <h2>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</h2>

    <p>
      In CSS, a class groups elements that are the same or similar. You can
      include any number of elements in a class, and each element can belong to
      multiple classes. Each class has specific CSS attributes, such as color
      and font-size.
    </p>
    <p>
      CSS classes are like a real-life class of students who share similarities
      in age, area codes, interests, or life goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      When inserting a class syntax, ensure the name you give the class between
      quotation marks (“”) is distinct, the name you give it can be literally
      anything.
