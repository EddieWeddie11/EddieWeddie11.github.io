    <h1>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</h1>

    <h2>Class</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        In CSS, a class groups elements that are the same or similar. You can
        include any number of elements in a class, and each element can belong
        to multiple classes. Each class has specific CSS attributes, such as
        color and font-size.
      </p>

      <p>
        CSS classes are like a real-life class of students who share
        similarities in age, area codes, interests, or life goals.
      </p>

      <p>
        When inserting a class syntax, ensure the name you give the class
        between quotation marks (“”) is distinct, the name you give it can be
        literally anything.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Syntax for class in the HTML</h3>
      <p>h1 class= "example 1"</p>
      <p>h2 class= "example 2"</p>

      <p>
        Syntax for class in the CSS Selector file (Use '.' (period symbol) for
        identifying your class))
      </p>

      <p>.example {color: blue; font-size: 14px;}</p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <h2>IDs</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        An ID uniquely identifies a single HTML tag, and each tag can only have
        one ID. Every ID has specific CSS attributes that apply only to that
        element.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a real-life analogy, while students may share attributes, each has a
        unique IRD Number or passport number that identifies them individually.
      </p>

      <p>
        When inserting a class syntax, ensure the name you give the class
        between quotation marks (“”) is distinct, the name you give it can be
        literally anything.
      </p>

      <br />

      <h3>Syntax for ID in the HTML</h3>
      <p>h1 id= ”unique 1”</p>
      <p>h2 id= ”unique 2”</p>

      <p>
        Syntax for ID in the CSS Selector file (Use ‘#’ for identifying your ID)
      </p>
      <p>#unique {color: red; font-size: 16px;}</p>

      <br />

      <h2>Best practices</h2>
      <li>
        Use an ID when you need to style one specific, unique element on a page
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a class when you need to style multiple elements with the same or
        similar styling
      </li>
      <li>
        IDs are for single, unique items, while classes are for groups of items
        that share styles
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep IDs distinct to avoid any conflicts and ensure clear, maintainable
        code
      </li>
    </div>
  </body>
