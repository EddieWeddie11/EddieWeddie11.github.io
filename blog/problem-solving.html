    <title>Problem Solving</title>
    <h1>were blocked on a simple problem</h1>
    <li>
      The problem was not properly reading the instructions and getting
      frustrated and stuck on a problem. The problem was if I wanted to make
      sure the codes were working on after researching 2 different methods of
      choice, I just had to copy and paste the node my-examples.js into console
      and it would run it.
    </li>
    <li>
      Problem solving techniques used were googling ways to console.log the
      methods. I tried changing the codes and re-writing the codes numerous
      times and it still wouldn’t show in console.
    </li>
    <li>
      I felt awfully frustrated because i knew console.log-ing something is just
      using the correct syntax and functions which is super simple but I
      couldnt’t figure it out. I decided to read all the instructions again and
      realised all I had to do was copy a piece of code already provided to see
      whether or not the code was working.
    </li>
    <li>
      I learnt to not skim read through things even if I think I understand it.
      It is better to just read through everything slowly once and not miss
      crucial information / instructions.
    </li>
    <h1>elegantly solved a problem</h1>
    <li>
      The problem was in the manipulating objects stage of JS Kata. Starting
      code is my biggest obstacle at the moment, but once I got going and
      started to see the repetition and realised that the following instruction
      gave the code needed for the current question I was able to figure the
      rest of the test 2-manipulating objects pretty quickly.
    </li>
    <li>
      I felt like a pro because I was able to just use common sense to figure
      out how to do the whole test without needed to ask for help or spend hours
      on Google.
    </li>
    <li>
      I learnt that sometimes it’s best to use to given resource as it may
      contain the answers and code required, and from there just use the
      appropriate values for future codes.

    <h1>
      Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made
      you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
    </h1>
    <li>
      I was never reluctant to ask for help as I know this is the best way to
      learn something from a different point of view. Throughout the whole JS
      Kata, my approach was do what I know without googling - reading through
      instructions and dissect what was required, google and youtube to make
      sure the right syntax were used, if neither of those worked I asked Dave
      Poole straight away. I could’ve asked Dave straight away and it would have
      saved a lot of time, but I know that the best way to learn is to make
      mistakes, so I let myself make the mistakes and have Dave guide me on
      where I went wrong and how to solve it.
