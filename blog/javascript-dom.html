    <h2>
      An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      HTML is like the framework and foundation of the house. It’s the basic
      structure, outlining where the rooms are, where the doors and windows will
      go, and how the house is laid out. It’s essential for the basic shape and
      purpose of the house but doesn’t make it look nice or functional yet.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      CSS is like the paint, wallpaper, and interior decorating. It makes the
      house look attractive, choosing colors for the walls, styles for the
      furniture, and ensuring everything looks nice and is pleasant to live in.
      CSS is all about making sure the house is aesthetically pleasing and
      well-organized.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      JavaScript is like the utilities and gadgets in the house. It’s what makes
      the house come to life and function interactively. Think of things like
      the lighting system, the heating and cooling, the smart home devices that
      respond to your commands, and the security system that reacts to motion.
      JavaScript adds the interactive and functional elements that make the
      house more than just a static structure.

      Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life
    </h2>
    <p>
      Control Flow is like following a recipe where you need to do certain steps
      in order, sometimes choosing between different actions based on
      conditions. Loops are like repeating certain steps multiple times, like
      stirring or baking multiple batches.
    </p>
    <br />
    <li>Preheat the oven.</li>
    <li>Mix the ingredients (Flour, Sugar, Eggs, Butter)</li>
    <li>Shape the dough into cookies</li>
    <li>Place the cookies on a baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Put the baking sheet in the oven.</li>
    <li>Bake for 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove the cookies from the oven.</li>
    <li>Let them cool.</li>
    <br />
    <h2>Loop</h2>
    <li>You have a bowl of cookie dough</li>
    <li>You take a piece of dough</li>
    <li>Shape it into a cookie</li>
    <li>Place it on the baking sheet</li>
    <li>Repeat until there's no dough left</li>

      Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
    </h2>
    <h3>What is the DOM?</h3>
    <p>
      The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web
      documents. It represents the structure of a webpage in a hierarchical tree
      format, where each node is an object representing a part of the document,
      such as an element, attribute, or text. The DOM allows programming
      languages like JavaScript to interact with the document, enabling dynamic
      changes to the content, structure, and style of a webpage.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Example of Interacting with the DOM</h3>
    <p>
      Let’s say you have a simple webpage with a heading and a button. You want
      to change the text of the heading when the button is clicked.

    <h2>Arrays & Objects</h2>
    <p>
      An array is like a row of books on a shelf in a library, where each book
      has a specific position (or index)
    </p>
    <li>
      Accessing by Position: To get a book, you need to know its exact spot on
      the shelf.
    </li>
    <li>Example: Imagine you have an array of favorite books.</li>
    <img src="array.png" />
    <br />
    <p>
      An object is like a library's catalog, where each book is listed with a
      unique title.
    </p>
    <li>Accessing by Key: To get a book, you use its title (or key)</li>
    <li>
      Example: Imagine you have an object where each book title is associated
      with its author
    </li>
    <img src="object.png" />
    <h2>Difference between Arrays & Objects</h2>
    <li>
      Arrays: Use an index (a number) to access data. let book =
      favoriteBooks[1]; // "Green Eggs and Ham"
    </li>
    <li>
      Objects: Use a key (a name) to access data. let author =
      libraryCatalog["Green Eggs and Ham"]; // "Dr. Seuss"
    </li>
    <br />
    <h2>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h2>
    <h3>What are Functions?</h3>
    <p>
      A function is like a recipe in a cookbook. It’s a set of instructions that
      you can follow to perform a specific task. In programming, a function is a
      reusable block of code designed to perform a particular operation.
    </p>
    <p>Example</p>
    <li>Take two slices of bread.</li>
    <li>Spread peanut butter on one slice.</li>
    <li>Spread jelly on the other slice.</li>
    <li>Put the slices together.</li>
    <p>In programming, this recipe could be a function called makeSandwich</p>
    <br />
    <h3>Why are Functions Helpful</h3>
    <li>
      Reusability: Once you write a function, you can use it as many times as
      you need without rewriting the same code.
    </li>
    <li>
      Organization: Functions help organize your code into smaller, manageable
      pieces, making it easier to read and understand.
    </li>
    <li>
      Maintainability: If you need to make changes, you only need to update the
      function in one place, rather than changing the same code in multiple
      places.
    </li>
    <li>
      Abstraction: Functions allow you to hide the complexity of certain
      operations. You only need to know how to use the function, not how it
      works internally.
    </li>
