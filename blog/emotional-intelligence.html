      What is Emotional Intelligence? Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability
      to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive ways to
      relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathize with others, overcome
      challenges, and defuse conflict. It involves: Self-awareness: Recognizing
      your own emotions and how they affect your thoughts and behavior.
      Self-regulation: Controlling or redirecting your disruptive emotions and
      impulses, and adapting to changing circumstances. Empathy: Understanding
      the emotions of others and treating them according to their emotional
      reactions. High emotional intelligence helps individuals navigate social
      complexities, lead and motivate others, and succeed in both personal and
      professional life.

      How is EQ different to IQ? Emotional intelligence (EQ) and intelligence
      quotient (IQ) differ primarily in focus and application. EQ involves
      understanding and managing one's own and others' emotions, encompassing
      self-awareness, empathy, and social skills, and it greatly influences
      personal relationships and leadership abilities. In contrast, IQ measures
      cognitive abilities such as logical reasoning, problem-solving, and
      information processing, impacting academic performance and technical
      skills. While EQ can be developed and enhanced over time through practice,
      IQ is relatively stable and innate, often assessed through standardized
      tests. Together, EQ and IQ contribute to a person's overall success, but
      they highlight different aspects of human intelligence.

      Why is EQ important? Emotional intelligence (EQ) is important because it
      helps you understand and manage your own emotions, connect with others,
      handle stress, and make better decisions. High EQ improves your
      relationships, communication, and ability to work well with others, making
      it essential for personal and professional success
