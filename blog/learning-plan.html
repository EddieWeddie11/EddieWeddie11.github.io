        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning My curiosity for learning new things is what drives me each
        day. I am always intrigued by new topics especially if it gives me the
        opportunity to upskill myself. Limitations for me would be reading as my
        mind starts to wonder when I read which would lead me to being
        distracted in my own thoughts, and given that foundations has been a lot
        of reading I found that awfully difficult. The way the readings sections
        were awfully casual and overly expressive and arelaid out in a more
        conversational way, which for me way off putting but I can understand
        how others might find that style inviting and engaging. I also get
        fixated on a problem and if I can’t solve it that will be the only thing
        I think about, it’s like having an itch I can’t scratch.

        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to
        work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
        industry/community representatives What you will do when things are
        building up and starting to get to you Making sure breaks are consistent
        and whenever I am not in class I switch off and not think about it.

        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way In
        my current job, if I have a non urgent question I would just store it
        somewhere safe and when we had our 1on1 I would just raise the question,
        however if it was urgent I would just ask straight away.

        A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team To not beat

        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in. N/A
        as of right now as I am lucky to be in a position where I have no major
        commitments. The only thing I am committed to is the gym as I think that
        is the best outlet after using your brain.
