      <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway? Business Owner</h2>
      <li>Business(s) owner</li>

      <h3>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h3>
      <li>
        My curiosity for learning new things is what drives me each day. I am
        always intrigued by new topics especially if it gives me the opportunity
        to upskill myself.
      </li>
      <li>
        Limitations for me would be reading as my mind starts to wonder when I
        read which would lead me to being distracted in my own thoughts, and
        given that foundations has been a lot of reading I found that awfully
        difficult. The way the readings sections were awfully casual and overly
        expressive and arelaid out in a more conversational way, which for me
        way off putting but I can understand how others might find that style
        inviting and engaging.
      </li>
      <li>
        I also get fixated on a problem and if I can’t solve it that will be the
        only thing I think about, it’s like having an itch I can’t scratch.
      </li>
      <h2>
        What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
        in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h2>
      <li>Clear concise but constructive feedback and communication</li>
      <h3>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h3>
      <li>
        In my current job, if I have a non urgent question I would just store it
        somewhere safe and when we had our 1on1 I would just raise the question,
        however if it was urgent I would just ask straight away.
      </li>
      <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
      <li>To not beat around the bush on my areas of improvement</li>

      <h3>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </h3>
      <li>
        N/A as of right now as I am lucky to be in a position where I have no
        major commitments. The only thing I am committed to is the gym as I
        think that is the best outlet after using your brain.
      </li>
      <h3>
        What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
        Bootcamp?
      </h3>
      <li>
        Strengths will be time management and workload management. I may not
        understand something straight away but I will find the answer to it
        eventually.
      </li>
      <li>Limitations will be balancing working and the bootcamp</li>
      <h3>
        What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
        be?
      </h3>
      <li>
        The non technical 1:1 check ins when i could be using that time to work
        with the team or on our project
      </li>
      <h3>
        What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <li>Public speaking</li>
      <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
      <li>
        Everyone speaking their minds and not shying away from constructive
        debates.
      </li>
      <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
      <li>
        To pass the bootcamp and Devaademy as a whole and to be comfortable
        using HTML, CSS and JS to a point where if I wanted to make something
        out of no where, I would have learnt the fundamentals and be able to
        start projects here and there.
