    <h3>
      What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due
      to the Human Skills learning?
    </h3>
    <li>
      Theres a big difference between someone saying something and someone
      meaning something
    </li>
    <h3>
      What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
      programming?
    </h3>
    <li>
      When someone is pitching a product that they want you to design, we have
      to realise that product is valuable to them and though we may not share
      the same perspective you have to respect their vision
    </li>
    <li>
      Empathy is important as if you’re not able to relate or understand their
      product pitch, it will make it difficult to feel as if you’re making
      progress. Trying to put yourself in their shoes is important
    </li>
    <li>
      Self awareness is important as well because at times programmers might be
      working to a tight deadline and sure getting the work done for your client
      or boss is important but if you’re sleep deprived and not getting enough
      nutrients in, there’s going to be long term consequence
    </li>
    <h3>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h3>
    <li>
      How much human skills and social skill is involved in programming. I
      thought it was just sitting in your little corner in your own world making
      and trouble shooting things
    </li>
    <h3>
      What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
    </h3>
    <li>
      Probably trying too hard to remember the fine dettails of the conversation
      and then completely blank out towards the latter stages of the
      conversation because im trying to remember what they said
    </li>
    <h3>
      Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
      focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </h3>
    <li>
      Because in the real world and in the workforce, in my opinion, the soft
      skills versus the hard skill split is probably 65-70 / 35-30 in favour of
      soft skills. There is no point in being a technical expert knowing
      Javascript or Python top to bottom, in and out if you’re unable to
      communicate with the client and or your ideas clearly.
    </li>
    <h3>
      Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
      waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
      instead? Justify your answer.
    </h3>
    <li>
      For me personally yes very much so, and I only say this purely from my
      upbringing. I have been working since the age of 9 in our family business
      (hospitality) which meant since the young age I have had to proactively
      socialise with customers in order to make any money, which meant I
      developed my social skills from a very young age. Then in my recruitment
      agency job which essentially is sales, cold calling and cold approaching
      candidates and clients for jobs was a must in order to meet monthly and
      quarterly targets, dealing with candidates and clients end to end taught
      me a lot when it came to dealing with people in struggling or entitled
      positions. Throughout the human skill sections I often found myself
      repeating “why am I doing this, this stuff comes from exposure from
      putting yourself out there and learning which I have been doing already
      and will continue to do throughout life both personally and
      professionally.
